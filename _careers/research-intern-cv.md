## About Us
At Neural Nurture, we are committed to advancing the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Our research lab focuses on solving some of the most exciting and challenging problems in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.

## Role Overview
We are seeking highly motivated research interns to join our team, with a focus on Computer Vision. Internship will center around developing and evaluating models at the intersection of vision and language, with an emphasis on robustness to real-world perturbations such as noise, occlusion, compression artifacts, and domain shifts. You will have the opportunity to work on challenging projects related to vision-language models, diffusion models, efficient training, and adversarial robustness, contributing to cutting-edge research in a fast-moving field. Key areas of focus will include, but are not limited to, Computer Vision robustness, Multimodal robustness, and other fundamental tasks in Computer Vision.

## Responsibilities
- Collaborate with research mentors to brainstorm and define solutions for challenging real-world problems
- Review relevant literature and existing approaches to identify gaps and opportunities for innovation
- Design novel solutions, build working prototypes, and perform comprehensive experiments
- Evaluate results of experiments, validate findings, and fine-tune models based on insights gained
- Present research results with other internal teams or at external academic or industry events
- Draft and refine research papers for submission to leading conferences

## Minimum Qualifications
- Currently pursuing a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics, or a related field
- Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, or other relevant languages
- Strong foundational knowledge of core machine learning concepts and mathematical principles
- Strong background in Computer Vision and Deep Learning
- Experience with Deep Learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a fast-paced environment
- Passion for research and a curiosity-driven mindset

## Preferred Qualifications
- Prior research experience including publications in major conferences or journals
- Strong coding skills in Python
- Familiarity with computer vision robustness concepts such as corruptions, adversarial attacks, and distribution shifts
- Experience working with Vision-Language Models or Multimodal Learning (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, LLaVA) is a plus
- Experience working with large-scale datasets and training models on cloud environments
