## About Us
At Neural Nurture, we are committed to advancing the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Our research lab focuses on solving some of the most exciting and challenging problems in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.

## Role Overview
We are seeking highly motivated research interns to join our team, with a focus on Natural Language Processing. Interns will contribute to projects centered on language understanding, model interpretability, and efficient deep learning. The position will focus on developing methods that improve the reliability and human-alignment of language models, with particular emphasis on areas like sentence acceptability evaluation, structured representations, and judgment-based learning.

This is an excellent opportunity for individuals interested in pushing the boundaries of how language models understand, reason, and interact in more human-aligned ways. Interns will have the opportunity to work on both fundamental research and practical applications, aiming for contributions to top-tier conferences in NLP and Machine Learning.

## Responsibilities
- Collaborate with research mentors to brainstorm and define solutions for challenging real-world problems
- Review relevant literature and existing approaches to identify gaps and opportunities for innovation
- Design novel solutions, build working prototypes, and perform comprehensive experiments
- Evaluate results of experiments, validate findings, and fine-tune models based on insights gained
- Present research results with other internal teams or at external academic or industry events
- Prepare and refine research papers for submission to leading conferences

## Minimum Qualifications
- Currently pursuing a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics, or a related field
- Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, or other relevant languages
- Strong foundational knowledge of core machine learning concepts and mathematical principles
- Strong background in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning
- Experience with Deep Learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a fast-paced environment
- Passion for research and a curiosity-driven mindset

## Preferred Qualifications
- Prior research experience including publications in major conferences or journals
- Strong coding skills in Python
- Familiarity with linguistic theory, structured prediction models, or human-centered evaluation methodologies
- Prior experience in research projects related to language model evaluation
- Familiarity with libraries like Hugging Face Transformers
- Experience working with large-scale datasets and training models on cloud environments
